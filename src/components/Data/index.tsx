    question: "How do your hydration infusion services help me?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        For optimal health we need to be adequately hydrated. With proper nutrition and hydration, we are able to treat
        and prevent diseases. IV infusions and injections provide immediate results by going directly into the
        bloodstream, completely bypassing the digestive system. IV infusion and injections provide increased blood
        concentration of vital nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, and hydration. Our hydrating treatments go straight to
        the cells most in need of a nutrient-filled hydration boost!

        Treatment frequency varies based on 2 main factors: metabolism and activity level. The quicker your metabolism
        and more active lifestyle you live, the faster you will burn through the benefits of your vitamin and nutrient
